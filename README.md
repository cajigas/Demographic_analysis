# Demographic analyses of Oophaga vicentei 
Bioinformatic scripts for the inference demographic trends in Oophaga vicentei.
The first scripts (*angsd_Saf_East.sh* and *angsd_Saf_West.sh*) were used to infer the site frequency spectra from the 
mappings of the RNAseq reads into O. sylvatica genome.
The other script (*stairway_plot.sh*) uses the inferred SFS of each population for configuring a Stairwayplot2 analysis
